#  Hotel Booking Data Analysis

Have you ever wondered when the best time of year to book a hotel room is? Or the optimal length of stay in order to get the best daily rate? What if you wanted to predict whether or not a hotel was likely to receive a disproportionately high number of special requests?

In this project, we explore and analyze a real-world hotel booking dataset to uncover patterns in customer behavior, booking trends, and cancellation rates. This is a data-driven investigation to understand the factors that govern hotel bookings.

##  Data Cleaning Steps

The dataset was first cleaned and prepared for analysis using the following steps:

1. **Missing Values**: Identified and handled appropriately using imputation or removal depending on context.
2. **Data Types**: Converted columns to their correct data types for accurate analysis (e.g., dates, integers, categories).
3. **Duplicates**: Detected and removed duplicate rows to ensure data integrity.
4. **Column-wise Preprocessing**: Performed specific transformations based on the meaning of each feature (e.g., one-hot encoding, feature engineering).



## Analysis Questions

Here are some of the key business questions explored in this project:

- Which **type of hotel** (City or Resort) is booked more frequently? (Pie chart visualization)
- What **percentage of bookings** get cancelled?

*... and several more insightful analyses to uncover booking behavior.*
